# Lessons Learned - [Pipeline Name]

> Template for: Content Management & Publishing Pipelines
> Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD

## Project Summary
[What content flows through this pipeline? From where to where? Who are the producers and consumers?]

## Pipeline Overview
```
[Source] → [Processing] → [Storage] → [Distribution] → [Audience]
```

## What Worked

### Ingestion Wins
- [Source integration that worked smoothly]
- [Format handling that saved time]
- [Automation that reduced manual work]

### Processing Wins
- [Transformation that added value]
- [Quality check that caught issues]
- [Enrichment that improved content]

### Distribution Wins
- [Channel that reached audience]
- [Format that performed well]
- [Timing/scheduling that worked]

### Editorial Wins
- [Workflow that editors liked]
- [Review process that caught errors]
- [Collaboration feature that helped]

## What Didn't Work

### Ingestion Failures
- [Source that broke or changed]
- [Format that caused problems]
- [Manual step that created bottleneck]

### Processing Issues
- [Transformation that corrupted content]
- [Quality check that missed errors]
- [Step that was too slow]

### Distribution Problems
- [Channel that underperformed]
- [Format that didn't render correctly]
- [Scheduling failure]

### Editorial Pain
- [Workflow friction]
- [Approval bottleneck]
- [Version control nightmare]

## Key Insights

### The Real Problem
[What content producers/consumers actually needed vs what you built]

### Volume Lessons
- [What broke at scale]
- [What scaled fine]
- [Capacity planning insights]

### Quality vs Speed Tradeoffs
- [Where quality was sacrificed]
- [Where speed was sacrificed]
- [Right balance in retrospect]

## Content Types Handled

| Type | Volume | Complexity | Notes |
|------|--------|------------|-------|
| [Articles] | [/day] | [low/med/high] | [notes] |
| [Images] | [/day] | [low/med/high] | [notes] |
| [Video] | [/day] | [low/med/high] | [notes] |

## Recommendations for Future Work

### If Continuing This Pipeline
- [Bottleneck to fix]
- [Automation to add]

### If Rebuilding
- [Architecture change]
- [Tool replacement]

## Artifacts Worth Keeping

| Component | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| [Ingestion scripts] | [Handles tricky source] |
| [Transform logic] | [Reusable patterns] |

## Integration Points
- **Sources:** [CMS, feeds, APIs, manual upload]
- **Storage:** [database, cloud storage, CDN]
- **Outputs:** [website, app, social, email]

## Operational Notes
- Typical throughput: [items/hour or day]
- Failure rate: [%]
- Recovery procedure: [steps]
- On-call contact: [who handles issues]
