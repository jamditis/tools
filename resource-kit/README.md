## Philosophy

- **Real problems** — Build things you actually need, not abstract exercises
- **Manager mindset** — You direct, AI writes code. Your job is architecture and verification.
- **Document everything** — Your changelog is your institutional memory
- **Trust but verify** — AI makes mistakes. Test edge cases. Review security.
