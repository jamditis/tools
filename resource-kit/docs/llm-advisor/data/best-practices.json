    "corePrinciples": [
      "Focus on the system, not just the model. Choose between Claude, Gemini, or ChatGPT as your primary platform and learn its features.",
      "Use the right tier for the task. Use fast 'chat' models (Sonnet, Flash) for quick questions and brainstorming. Manually switch to powerful 'work' models (Claude 4.5 Opus, GPT 5.1, Gemini 3.0 Pro) for any high-stakes analysis, writing, or coding.",
      "Trust, but always verify. Every fact, quote, and statistic generated by an AI must be independently verified. Hallucinations are less common but still occur, especially in faster models.",
      "You are the journalist. The AI is a tool to augment your abilities. You are ultimately responsible for the accuracy, fairness, and integrity of your work."
    ],
    "promptingTechniques": [
      "Write Clearer Instructions. Newer models like GPT-5 are very literal. Avoid contradictory instructions (e.g., telling it to 'never do X' and then asking it 'to do X'). Be direct and specific about what you want.",
      "Ask the AI to 'Think First'. For complex tasks, ask the model to create a plan or a rubric before writing the final answer. This often results in more structured and higher-quality outputs.",
      "Use the AI to Improve Your Prompts. If you aren't getting the results you want, describe the problem to the AI and ask it how you could improve your prompt to get a better answer. This 'metaprompting' is a powerful way to learn.",
      "Get the AI to Be More (or Less) Proactive. You can tell the model to be more thorough and take more steps on its own, or you can tell it to be quick and only do the bare minimum. A simple instruction like 'Be as thorough as possible' or 'Provide a brief answer' can make a big difference."
    ],
    "workflowIntegration": [
      "Use 'deep research' for comprehensive reports. This feature (available in all major systems) is far more powerful than a simple web search and provides better citations.",
      "Use voice mode for mobile productivity. The killer feature is screen/camera sharing—point your phone at something to have the AI see and discuss it with you in real-time.",
      "Check the AI's 'thinking'. If you get a strange result, use the 'show thinking' or similar feature to see the steps the model took. This can help you spot errors in its logic.",
      "Use a changelog to maintain context across sessions. This is especially helpful for complex, multi-day projects. You can find a <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1apf8wb_xiYisbyLNGtDIiMCTlj5iuIYt/view?usp=sharing' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' class='underline'>changelog template here</a> that you can upload to the LLM at the start of your conversation."
    ],
    "imagePrompting": [
      "Describe the scene, don't just list keywords. A narrative, descriptive paragraph will almost always produce a better, more coherent image.",
      "For photorealistic images, think like a photographer. Mention camera angles, lighting, and fine details to guide the model.",
      "For stickers or logos, be explicit about the style (e.g., 'kawaii-style sticker') and request a white background if needed for easy editing.",
      "To add text to an image, clearly state the exact text you want, describe the font style, and specify its placement in the overall design."
    ],
    "ethicalGuidelines": [
      "Protect your sources and your data. Never upload confidential information to a public AI service.",
      "Understand the privacy policies. Claude does not train on your data by default. For Gemini and ChatGPT, you may need to go into the settings and manually turn off data training to ensure privacy.",
      "Guard against bias. Be aware that LLMs are trained on vast amounts of internet data and can perpetuate societal biases. Critically evaluate outputs for biased language or perspectives.",
      "Disclose AI use. Be transparent with your editor and your audience about how AI was used in your reporting. Always label AI-generated images."
    ],
    "gemini3Advanced": [
      "<strong>Core principles for Gemini 3:</strong> Gemini 3 favors directness over persuasion. Be concise and precise in your prompts. State your goal clearly without fluff.",
      "<strong>Structured prompting:</strong> Use XML-style tags or Markdown to structure your prompts. This provides clear boundaries between instructions and data. Example: <code>&lt;rules&gt;Be objective. Cite sources.&lt;/rules&gt; &lt;context&gt;[Your data]&lt;/context&gt;</code>",
      "<strong>Explicit planning:</strong> Before providing the final answer, ask Gemini to: 1) Parse the goal into sub-tasks, 2) Check if information is complete, 3) Consider 'power user' methods, 4) Create a structured outline, 5) Validate understanding before proceeding.",
      "<strong>Self-critique prompts:</strong> Before returning the final response, ask Gemini to review its output: 'Did I answer the user's intent, not just literal words? Is the tone authentic? If I made assumptions, did I flag them?'",
      "<strong>Context anchoring:</strong> When transitioning from a large block of data to your query, explicitly bridge the gap with phrases like 'Based on the information above...' before your question.",
      "<strong>Long context structure:</strong> When working with large documents or codebases, place your specific instructions at the END of the prompt, after all the context data.",
      "<strong>Output verbosity control:</strong> Gemini 3 is less verbose by default. If you need more detailed or conversational outputs, explicitly request it in your prompt.",
      "<strong>Multimodal coherence:</strong> When using text, images, audio, or video together, reference specific modalities clearly in your instructions to ensure Gemini synthesizes across them rather than analyzing in isolation."
