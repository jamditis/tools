| **robust** | Meaningless modifier | "reliable", "stable", or delete |
| **transformative** | Hyperbolic | "changed", "improved", or be specific |
| **leveraging** | Corporate jargon | "using" |
| **seamlessly** | Almost always false | Delete, or describe actual integration |
| **innovative** | Empty praise | Describe what's actually new |
| **cutting-edge** | Dated buzzword | Be specific about what's new |
| **state-of-the-art** | Cliché | Describe the actual technology |
| **holistic** | Vague | "complete", "full", or be specific |

## Cliché Sentence Patterns (Rewrite)
### "Not just X—it's Y" pattern
❌ "This isn't just a tool—it's a platform"
❌ "This wasn't just documentation—it was a knowledge base"
❌ "Not just a technical milestone, but a conceptual shift"
✅ State the thing directly without the dramatic setup
### "Fundamentally transforms" pattern
❌ "This fundamentally transforms how we..."
❌ "This represents a fundamental shift in..."
✅ Describe the actual change without the hyperbole
### Inflated achievement claims
❌ "A critical enhancement"
❌ "A major milestone"
❌ "A significant improvement"
❌ "A game-changer"
❌ "A breakthrough"
✅ Just describe what was done and let readers judge significance
### Empty transitions
❌ "With that in mind..."
❌ "Building on this foundation..."
❌ "Taking this a step further..."
✅ Just make the next point

## Filler Phrases to Delete
These phrases add no meaning and can usually be removed entirely:
- "It's worth noting that..."
- "It's important to understand that..."
- "In order to..."  → "To..."
- "Due to the fact that..." → "Because..."
- "At the end of the day..."
- "When all is said and done..."
- "In today's world..."
- "Moving forward..."
- "Going forward..."
- "At this point in time..." → "Now..."
- "In terms of..."
- "With respect to..." → "About..." or "For..."

## Vague Intensifiers
Words that pretend to add meaning but don't:
- "very" (usually delete)
- "extremely" (be specific instead)
- "incredibly" (hyperbolic)
- "absolutely" (usually unnecessary)
- "truly" (usually unnecessary)
- "literally" (often misused)
- "actually" (often unnecessary)
- "basically" (often unnecessary)
- "essentially" (often better to just state the thing)

## Redundant Modifiers
- "completely finished" → "finished"
- "totally unique" → "unique"
- "very unique" → "unique" (uniqueness isn't gradable)
- "absolutely essential" → "essential"
- "critically important" → "important"
- "end result" → "result"
- "future plans" → "plans"
- "past history" → "history"
- "general consensus" → "consensus"
- "close proximity" → "proximity"

## The "Rich" Problem
AI loves the word "rich" as a modifier:
- "rich data"
- "rich knowledge graph"
- "rich ecosystem"
- "rich feature set"
Usually it means nothing. Delete it or be specific about what makes something substantial.

## Red Flags in Technical Writing
Watch for these patterns that suggest AI-generated padding:
1. **Lists of near-synonyms**: "comprehensive, sophisticated, and robust" (pick one or none)
2. **Excessive hedging**: "may potentially be able to possibly..."
3. **Noun stacking**: "production-ready deployment system infrastructure"
4. **Passive voice hiding agency**: "It was determined that..." (by whom?)
5. **Circular definitions**: "The system enables users to use the functionality that the system provides"

## Quick Test
Before accepting AI-generated text, ask:
1. Can I delete this word/phrase without losing meaning? → Delete it
2. Is this the simplest way to say this? → Simplify
3. Would I say this out loud to a colleague? → If not, rewrite
4. Does this add information or just sound impressive? → If the latter, cut it

## Examples of Good Rewrites
❌ "The comprehensive entity extraction system leverages sophisticated algorithms to enable robust knowledge graph construction."
✅ "The entity extraction system builds knowledge graphs from archive records."
❌ "This transformative milestone fundamentally reshapes the archive's research capabilities."
✅ "This changes how researchers can use the archive."
❌ "A comprehensive suite of data maintenance tools was developed to ensure the quality and consistency of the archived data."
✅ "We built tools to maintain data quality."

*Remember: Good writing is invisible. If readers notice the writing, it's getting in the way of the content.*

# NEVER use or write in Title Case. Always use and write in Sentence case.
