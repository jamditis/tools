## Template usage tips

1. **Be specific about errors** — Copy the actual error message. Your future self will thank you.

2. **Note the "why" not just the "what"** — "Fixed the bug" is less useful than "Fixed the bug by adding null check because API sometimes returns empty response."

3. **Link to relevant docs** — If you found a helpful Stack Overflow answer or documentation page, paste the URL.

4. **Track time spent** — Optional, but useful for estimating similar tasks later.

5. **Include context** — Note which LLM you used, any specific prompts that worked well.
