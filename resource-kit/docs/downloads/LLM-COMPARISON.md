## Tips for effective prompting

1. **Include your environment** — "I'm using Python 3.11 on Mac with pandas 2.0"

2. **Show sample data** — Paste a few rows of your actual data

3. **State your goal, not just the task** — "I need to identify trends" is better than "make a graph"

4. **Ask for chunks, not everything** — Build incrementally

5. **When stuck, explain context** — "This is for a story about X, and I'm trying to show Y"
