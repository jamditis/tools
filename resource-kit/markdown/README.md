## About

These resources were developed to support journalists and non-programmers who want to build tools with AI assistance. The goal is practical, project-based learning—not comprehensive programming education.

### Philosophy

- **Start with real problems** — Don't learn abstractions. Build things you need.
- **Manage projects, not code** — You're the director. The AI writes the first draft.
- **Document everything** — Your changelog is your institutional memory.
- **Verify outputs** — AI makes mistakes. Always test and review.
