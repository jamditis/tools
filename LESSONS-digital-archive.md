# Lessons Learned - [Archive Name]

> Template for: Digital Archives & Preservation Projects
> Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD

## Project Summary
[What is being archived? Whose work? What time period? What's the preservation goal?]

## Collection Overview
- **Total items:** [count]
- **Date range:** [start] - [end]
- **Content types:** [articles, audio, video, images, documents]
- **Primary sources:** [websites, publications, personal files]

## What Worked

### Acquisition Wins
- [Scraping/crawling approach that worked]
- [API or data source that was reliable]
- [Relationship that gave access]

### Preservation Wins
- [Format decisions that aged well]
- [Metadata schema that proved useful]
- [Storage solution that scaled]

### Access Wins
- [Search/discovery feature users loved]
- [Interface design that worked]
- [Citation/sharing feature]

## What Didn't Work

### Acquisition Failures
- [Source that went dark]
- [Anti-scraping measure that blocked us]
- [Content that couldn't be captured]

### Preservation Issues
- [Format that degraded or became obsolete]
- [Metadata gap that caused problems]
- [Storage/backup failure]

### Access Problems
- [Discoverability issue]
- [Rights/permissions blocker]
- [Performance problem at scale]

## Key Insights

### The Real Problem
[What researchers/users actually needed vs what you built]

### Content Lessons
- [What content was most valuable]
- [What was missing that people wanted]
- [Unexpected use cases]

### Sustainability Lessons
- [Ongoing maintenance burden]
- [Funding/resource requirements]
- [Institutional support needs]

## Rights & Permissions
- [Copyright status of materials]
- [Permissions obtained]
- [Outstanding rights issues]
- [Takedown requests received]

## Recommendations for Future Work

### If Continuing This Project
- [Priority gaps to fill]
- [Maintenance tasks]

### If Starting a Similar Archive
- [What to prioritize]
- [What to skip]

## Artifacts Worth Keeping

| Component | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| [Scraper code] | [Reusable for similar sources] |
| [Metadata schema] | [Could be standard for similar projects] |

## Stakeholders & Relationships
- [Subject/creator of archived work]
- [Institutional partners]
- [User communities]

## Technical Notes
- Storage location: [cloud service, institutional repository]
- Backup strategy: [approach]
- Access URL: [if public]
